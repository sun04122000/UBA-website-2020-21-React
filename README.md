Unnat Bharat Abhiyan is inspired by the vision of transformational change in rural development processes by leveraging knowledge institutions to help build the architecture of an Inclusive India. Its mission is conceptualized as a movement to enable processes that connect institutes of higher education with local communities to address the developmental challenges of rural India through participatory processes and appropriate technologies for accelerating sustainable growth. It also aims to create a virtuous cycle between the society and an inclusive university system by providing knowledge and practices for emerging professions and to upgrade the capabilities of both the public and the private sectors.

Under the aegis of UBA, IIT Roorkee has identified 8 villages namely Beladi-Salhapur, Chandpur-Khurd, Chandpur-Kala, Horawala, Chharba, Jhabarpur, Meerpur-Muwazarpur and Puranpur-Salhapur.
